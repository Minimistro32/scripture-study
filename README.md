### Study Skills
TODO: Every study skill ends with "So what?"
#### Principles of Substitution	
This is when you substitute an equivalent word or phrase that you know for a word or phrase in the text.
- Insert your name.
- Follow the pronoun.
- Define words.
   - Regular definitions
   - Archaic definitions
   - The Lord’s definitions

#### Determine the Setting
This is where you seek to understand the context of a passage by answering:
- Who?
- When?
- Where?

#### Look for Flag Phrases
This is when you read certain words and phrases as flags which grab and/or direct your attention.
- Words for emphasis, attention, focus.
- Summary phrases.
- Similes.
- Superlatives.
- Absolutes.
- Connecting words.
- Repeated words, phrases, actions.

#### Clustering
This is when you go to other passages of scripture that discuss the same story or doctrine or principle and see how they add to or illuminate the original passage.
“Cluster the scriptures topically, as if they were a bunch of grapes from which you would then squeeze all the juice, and distill all the meaning” (Neal A. Maxwell, “The Old Testament: Relevancy Within Antiquity,” an address given to CES Religious Educators, 16 August 1979, 89).

#### Look for Lists.
- General
- Ordered
   1. Ask, “What is implied by the order in which these items are listed? Process? Hierarchy? Chronology? Etc.
   1. Ask, “What is missing from this list that I might have expected to find here? Why is it not here?”

#### Look for Cause and Effect.
This is when you notice that a scripture writer is demonstrating how a certain action or attitude will bring about a certain result. The action or attitude is the CAUSE and the result is the EFFECT. 
- If / then
- Inasmuch
- Because

#### Visualize.
This is when you picture a scripture story as if it were a movie. This requires you to make decisions about how to depict certain moments in scripture. These decisions give you the chance to think about scripture text in different ways and gain different insights.
1. Determine the setting.
1. Look for details.
1. Ask questions.

#### Understand Symbolism.
This is when you take time to reap the benefits of the author’s use of symbolism by having the experience he has created  by employing the symbol.
1. Look for scriptural interpretation.
1. Consider the context
1. Consider the nature of the symbol itself.

#### Look for Principles.
This is when you state truths that can be applied in your life.
1. Ask, “So, what?”
1. Complete the statement, “Thus we see . . .”

### Additional Considerations

- Hyperbole
- Metaphor

- Parallelism (repeating, contrasting, amplifying, chiasm)
